The Booxter for Mac is the application allows you to collect information about books in your home library.  This post describes the creation of a simple ExtractBooks utility that is extracting some data about books stored in the SQLite database used by the Booxter and loads this data into the MongoDB database. The purpose of this little project is to build expertise in creating a server-side logic using Swift programming language, and this is the first step. It should help later in creating generation templates used by the Data Model Widgets to generate source code in Swift for the different databases like MYSQL, SQLite or PostgreSQL.
